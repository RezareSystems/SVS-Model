              "Text": "\n# SCRUM: the Simple Crop Resource Uptake Model\n\n_Hamish Brown and Rob Zyskowski, Plant and Food Research, New Zealand_\n\nThis model has been built using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) of [brown_plant_2014] to simulate a range of different crops in simulations where water and nitrogen balance are of interest but a fully mechanistic plant model is not needed or is not available. It is a daily time step implementation of the crop model that is used on the Overseer nutrient balance model [Cichota_etal_2010].  It uses simple sigmoidal functions for estimating daily cover and biomass deltas to give realistic water and nitrogen demands. It does not simulate potential yield, this is specified as an input. Yield will be reduced below the specified potential yield if N or water supplies from the soil are insufficient to meet demand. The model has been paramaterised for simulating water and nitrogen balances of cropping rotations in New Zealand (where over 50 different crop types are grown and it is not feasible to produce full crop models for each of these).  Because of this the model is not as generically applicable as full APSIM crop models.   It may be adapted for other purposes and other crop types may be added but the user will need to keep in mind that because it is a simple model the the parameters might need changing for crops in different locations or for crops sown at different times of the year.  Some sensibility testing or validation is recommended before application in different sutuations.   \n\nSCRUM has a simple phenology model which divides the crop growth into three main phases; a vegetative phase when the canopy is expanding, a reproductive phase when product is being formed and a senescing phase when the canopy is contracting.  SCRUM has 4 organ classes to represent different biomass components and the real biomass components that these classes represent changes from crop to crop:  \n   1. A Simple leaf class called <b>Stover</b> which represents the unharvested parts of the plant.  Generally, this represents the leaf and stem components of the crop but for crops where stem and leaf are part of the harvested product (e.g forages and leafy vegetables) than stover is the residual fraction of leaf and stem that is not harvested.  \n   2. A Generic organ class called <b>Product</b> which represents the plant parts that are harvested and removed from the field.  This could represent grain, fruits, tubers, leaf or stem depending on what sort of crop is being represented.  \n   3. A Root organ which extracts water and nitrogen from the soil for plant growth and returns biomass to the soil on harvest  \n   4. A Nodule organ which is only activated and fixes nitrogen for the legume crops.  \nAn Arbitrator is also included which determines the allocation of drymatter and nitrogen biomass between each of these organs.\n\n#Inclusion in APSIM simulations\nA scrum crop is included in a simulation the same as any other APSIM crop  \n * The SCRUM object needs to be dragged or copied from the Crop folder in the tool box into the field of your simulation.  \n * It is then planted with a sowing rule  \n~~~\nSCRUM.Sow(cultivar: Wheat_Autumn, population: 1, depth: 10, rowSpacing: 150);  \n~~~\n  * Note that SCRUM has no notion of population or rowSpacing but these parameters are required by the Sow method so filler values are provided  \n  * To specify an expected Expected Yield that differs to the defalt value provided, included the following code in a manager script to be executed on the day of sowing.\n~~~\n zone.Set(\"[SCRUM].Product.ExpectedYield.Value()\", ResetValue);  \n~~~\n* SCRUM can be Harvested, Cut, Grazed and Pruned like other crops.  Defalt proportions of the biomass in each organ are removed from the sysem and/or added to the fields residue pools.  Note that defalt removal fraction for product on harvest is 0 (becaue it is represented with a generic organ) so more appropriate removal fractions should be sepcified in a manager script as follows:  \n~~~\n[EventSubscribe(\"Commencing\")]  \nprivate void OnSimulationCommencing(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  Remove = new RemovalFractions(SCRUM.Organs);  \n}  \n[EventSubscribe(\"DoManagement\")]    \nprivate void OnDoManagement(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  if (Clock.Today.Date == HarvestDate2)  \n  {  \n    Remove.SetFractionLiveToRemove(\"Product\", 1.0);\n    Remove.SetFractionLiveToRemove(\"Stover\", 0.05);  \n    Remove.SetFractionLiveToResidue(\"Stover\",0.95)\n    SCRUM.Harvest(Remove);  \n    SCRUM.EndCrop();  \n  }  \n}  \n~~~\n* A Remove class as shown above can be sent with Harvest, Cut, Graze and Prune events to specificy the proportions of removals.\n * Once a crop has been ended the field is open to plant another crop using another APSIM crop model or sowing another SCRUM crop.  \n",

These rotations ran over three years and were conducted to provide data for testing N leaching predictions of different models.  SCRUM yields were set to the High N full irrigation treatment values for each crop and SCRUMs N and water responses were allowed to predict any differences in crop N uptake.  It is importnat to note that the soilN organic matter degridation coefficients were set to custom (non-release) values as this has been necessary to predict accurate N mineralisation values in new zealand arable soils.  \r\n\r\nSCRUM gave reasionable predictions of Product N removals, soil water contents and accumulated leaching from each crop treatment.  This provides further support that SCRUM is adequate for the task of providing realistic N and Water uptakes for the purpose of N and water balance studies. ",

These rotations ran over three years and were conducted to provide data for testing N leaching predictions of different models.  SCRUM yields were set to the High N full irrigation treatment values for each crop and SCRUMs N and water responses were allowed to predict any differences in crop N uptake.  It is importnat to note that the soilN organic matter degridation coefficients were set to custom (non-release) values as this has been necessary to predict accurate N mineralisation values in new zealand arable soils.  \r\n\r\nSCRUM gave reasionable predictions of Product N removals, soil water contents and accumulated leaching from each crop treatment.  This provides further support that SCRUM is adequate for the task of providing realistic N and Water uptakes for the purpose of N and water balance studies. ",

These rotations ran over three years and were conducted to provide data for testing N leaching predictions of different models.  SCRUM yields were set to the High N full irrigation treatment values for each crop and SCRUMs N and water responses were allowed to predict any differences in crop N uptake.  It is importnat to note that the soilN organic matter degridation coefficients were set to custom (non-release) values as this has been necessary to predict accurate N mineralisation values in new zealand arable soils.  \r\n\r\nSCRUM gave reasionable predictions of Product N removals, soil water contents and accumulated leaching from each crop treatment.  This provides further support that SCRUM is adequate for the task of providing realistic N and Water uptakes for the purpose of N and water balance studies. ",
